.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the add\-etc\-hosts and the rm\-etc\-hosts commands\.
.
.P
add\-etc\-hosts is a script that \fBenables\fR a local "bogus" hostname to be used on the loopback interface for development purposes\. While developing sites locally it\'s convenient to refer to the sites through an handle so that they can easily be reached\. The way to do that is by editing the \fB/etc/hosts\fR file and adding the desired hostname to the line relative to \fB127\.0\.0\.1\fR\. This script automates that process\.
.
.P
If the \fB\-6\fR optional argument is specified then it adds the hostname also to the IPv6 loopback \fB::1\fR\.
.
.P
Likewise, rm\-etc\-hosts disables a hostname by removing the hostname from \fB/etc/hosts\fR\.
.
.P
If the hostname exists already in \fB/etc/hosts\fR then trying to add it again has no effect\.
.
.P
If the hostname doesn\'t exist in \fB/etc/hosts\fR then trying to remove it has no effect\.
.
